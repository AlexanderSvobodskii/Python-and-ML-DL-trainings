    "To predict the continuation of the text, we transmit the last character to the network, it predicts the next character, which we again transmit to the input, receive another predicted character, and so on. Our predictions are based on a categorical probability distribution over all possible characters. We can limit the number of characters at each generation step to make the resulting predicted text more intelligent by considering only some of the most likely characters. On the one hand, this approach will allow us to consider not only the most probable sequence from the point of view of the model prediction. On the other hand, we will work with a limited set of generated options, so we will get rid of completely noisy predictions. You can find more [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.topk.html#torch.topk)."
